	<h3>
	Hello welcome to the website all about me
	</h3>
	<h4>
	My project idea
	</h4>
    <p>
	 My project idea for assessment 2 will be to create a game. the reason behind why I made this decision is because I have always had an interest in games. there the reason behind why I've had a connection to technology in the first place games like technology is ever-changing and when new and improved technology is developed and sold to the world there comes new and innovative ways to bring excitement through games. they turn monotony into an adventure. also, due to my overwhelming interest in the gaming world, my mind is always coming up with new ideas for games and I have always wished I could turn these idea's into a reality. for this assignment, I have two ideas of the game I want to create. one being a Bit survival game and another being a simple dodge ball game. I've always loved survival games as they can be challenging and the player needs to be creative to find a solution to a problem. on the other hand, a dodgeball game would be easy to create and I used to love playing dodgeball back in highschool it was fast pasted and could be challenging when you were up against a tougher opponent I hope my thoughts and feelings of this high school game would be shared between other people 

in terms of the type of game I would like to create I am swaying towards a doge ball-themed mobile game whose target audience is mainly younger mobile users this game will be designed to be played wherever whenever it would not require an internet connection and with simple controls a right and left button for movement and a button to throw the ball. The rules are based upon the actual game of dodge ball however the difference is when the opponent/user have been hit by a ball they do not go out instead the player or NPC who threw the ball will win a point once a character gets to three points they win the match.
the user can go against NPC,s "non-playable characters" or other users via 
the internet or split-screen. there will be a single background being high school gym themed this background will not change or be able to be interacted with in any way also the character's in the game will not be able to be changed or edited by the user this choice is influenced by the fact that my skills with coding and game development are still very low thus a simple system will be easier to code. this will also ensure it is easy for a user to quickly understand how to play the game as the controls only require three buttons. all they will require then is good timing skills to hit the opponent at the right time however a drawback to this strategy in development is that a simple game may not be very engaging to users for very long this would make my project a waste as it would not be played by users thus there's no reason to create it in the first place one way to overcome this problem is to make the game increasingly challenging to keep users concentrated on winning additionally y split-screen would promote a challenge between two users this competition would be engaging for users who are attempting to beat there friends and family at the game. 
	
the necessary tools I require to create the game will be using the cross-platform game developer unity. unity is a tool that will enable me to streamline the development of the project since the software already contains certain game mechanics which means I do not have to code them in myself. any additional code will come from visual studios or c sharp since I will be able to write code and then directly input it into unity. in terms of skills necessary to complete the project I only require a basic understanding of how unity works which I will be developing through online tutorials and YouTube videos additionally as my use of unity while working on this project continues it will show sharpen my skillset with the software. additionally, I will also require a basic understanding of how to code instructions into the game this is a problem since I've never created a game before I will be unsure with what to do and how to do it however my skills will be developed as I create the game, I will also be using the internet as a tool to work out problems with coding and to write and insert new pieces of code. these means will allow me to overcome my lack of experience, however, even though I have a plan of attack when it comes to overcoming this problem. It's still going to increase the time it takes to complete the project as I will be needing to search for the correct solution and then forming it to fit into my code to work as I desire it to this means I will need to put in considerably more effort to complete this project efficiently.
once completed the game will be able to be played via single-player or split-screen and should run smoothly due to its simplicity it should be easy to learn while still being challenging to play although I would not expect a user to play this game continuously as the game lacks depth and thorough engagement. however, the game should be able to make a monotonous moment fun and challenging while also distracting the user at the same time.
